                Currently a software engineer supporting the FAA's VOR MON and TACAN MON programs.

            <p>
                I was a welder in my previous career, specifically a Boilermaker, working on critical infrastructure such as power stations, oil refineries, and chemical plants.
                That experience instilled in me a deep appreciation for mission-critical systems and the sense of safety required to work on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as a software engineer, my career focus is to build and maintain technology that supports defense, transportation, and aviation.
                I take pride in contributing to systems where precision, reliability, and safety are paramount.
